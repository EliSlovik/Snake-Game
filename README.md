# Snake-Game
This is a python repository that outlines the different aspects and steps of my coding project: Snake Game
I will create  snake game in several steps: first I have created 2 squares, one moveable by arrows. once the player square overlaps with the 'food' square, the food square will move someplace else. I will then impliment a score mechanism which adds 1 to the score whenever the food moves, and I will create a snake body length. I will then make a check to check if the snake overlaps with its own body.
